	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<p> Hello! My name is Olivia MacDougal and I was born and raised in Saint Louis, MO.  Growing up, I spent most of my time exploring the great outdoors or reading (mostly fiction) books. From canoeing down the Meramec river with my older sister,
	climbing the big oak tree in my back yard, or fishing with my Dad, I've always had a passion for being in nature.</p>

	<p>It wasn't until my senior year of high school that I discovered a passion for technology when a friend encouraged me to join the FIRST Robotics team at my school. I also discovered my love of languages while in high school, which is where I first started taking Spanish classes and started to self-study Italian.</p>

	<p>I am currently a sophomore studying Computer Science at Tufts University. I am an active member of the Tufts Mountain Club and have hiked seven mountains over 4000 ft last semester alone! In the spring of 2017, I plan to study abroad in Madrid, Spain.</p>
