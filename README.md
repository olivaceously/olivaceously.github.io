Portfolio - Assignment 1 for Comp 20 (Tufts University)

1.  All aspects of the required elements have been implemented in full, and 
	are fully functional. All pages pass both the W3C HTML and CSS Verfication
	tests with no errors or warnings. I added an additional Contact page, as well.

2.  I asked for design and aesthetic advice from my parents, friends who
	are not in the class (Kathryn Gibson, Aviva Kardener, and Taylor Amp),
	as well as a number of classmates, including Tommy Tang, Aubrey
	Anderson, Sophie Loman, and Romy Aboudarham. As far as actually completing
	the coding part of the assignment, I did not collaborate with anyone, as per
	the assignment specification.
	I also used the Mozilla Developers website as a reference guide about creating
	boxes, email links, as well as many other miscellaneous questions throughout
	the completion of this project.

3.  I believe I spent about 5 hours on this project. Coding the actual content took
	very little time, but then implementing and deciding on stylistic elements took
	the bulk of my time -- I wanted it to look pretty, and at least semi-professional.
